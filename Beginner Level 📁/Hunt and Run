/*
You are hunting for food with an initial stamina of (x), and after every (y) kilometers,
you find a food item that gives you additional stamina to run further. There are a total of (n) food items, 
where the i-th food item gives you (A[i]) stamina. Find the total distance you can run.
INPUTS :-
1. x: The initial stamina.
2. Ð£: Distance between consecutive food items.
3. n: Number of food items.
4. A: Array of stamina values, where each A[i] represents the stamina obtained from the i-th food item.
